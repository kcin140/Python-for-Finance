 Algorithms for financial data analysis

-Understand if there is a day of the month that correlates with an upward or downward influx of the market price. For example, if I were to begin a DCA plan in 1969 where I put in $100/mo into a total market index fund, which day of the month would be the ideal day to buy and produce the largest return. Subsequently, which day of the month would correlate with the lowest return. 

-After obtaining the results, we then need to understand the results to identify if they are purely coincidental or if there is potential reasoning behind the results. 

-Potential hypothesis: Buying on the 1st or the 15th of the month may result in lower long term DCA returns due to a slightly higher saturated market from 401k deposits or others that DCA.
